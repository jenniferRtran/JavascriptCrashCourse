# Javascript Crash Course

* YouTube video: https://youtu.be/hdI2bqOjy3c?si=2eeVN_zTIePvH7WB

* Note-taking from clip:
- JavaScript: client-side programming = code that runs on your client machine
- Python, PHP, C#, Java, etc.: server-side programming
- DOM: Document Object Model - a tree structure of your whole document
- window object is the parent object of the browser.
To see, write console.log(window);
- If you want to have an application where you save data, you're gonna have to have back-end that interacts with a database such as Node.js, PHP, Python, etc. Then you send requests from your front-end using fetch API or Ajax. Or use local storage where you can actually store data in user's browser.
